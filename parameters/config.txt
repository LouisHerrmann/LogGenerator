# Replay parameters
# max_trace_length: max supported trace length when simulating model
# max_cycles:  max number of cycles until aborting when simulating model
# ignore_self_loops: whether to ignore self loops when simulating model
# minimize_for_node_coverage: if this is false, we achieve path coverage under the parameter requirements (this can
#                                                                                       lead to longer replay times)

# Merging parameters
# max_iterations: max traces to combine when merging different object type's traces
# max_retries: max number of tries we restart the merging of traces (in case, there still are unmatched shared
#                                       activities after, we pick the one with the fewest unmatched activities)

# Log generation parameters
# start_date: start date of first event in log
# min_time_stepsize: min time between events in hours
# max_time_stepsize: max time between events in hours
