# LogGenerator
Input: 
 - Dot-format object-centric BPMN model (see input/example.dot, examples can be found on DataDog: Merged Graph log messages)
 - Parameter file (see parameters/config.txt for an example and overview/explanation of all the parameters)
 
Output:
 - Collection of csv log files (one for each object type generated by replaying and merging the BPMN model for each object type)

Functionality:
 1. Dot file is converted to internal graph structure
 2. Object-centric BPMN model is flattened/projected on to each object type
 3. We simulate/replay traces separately for each object type
 4. To combine the various traces generated from the flattened BPMN models, we build partial order graphs where we merge traces of different object types based on shared activities
 5. During merging of traces, we try to minimize the number of unmatched shared activities
 6. The partial order graphs are converted into an OCEL format. This is also the step where we assign timestamps to the events
 7. Finally, the OCEL is flattened for each object type and the csv log files are generated
