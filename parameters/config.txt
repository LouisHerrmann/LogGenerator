# Replay parameters
# max_trace_length: max supported trace length when simulating model
# max_cycles: max number of times a node may be visited until aborting when simulating model. This does not only
#      include activity cycles, but all cycles in model. To achieve complete node coverage XOR cycles might be required.
# ignore_self_loops: whether to ignore self loops when simulating model
# minimize_for_node_coverage: if this is false, we achieve path coverage under the parameter requirements, so except for
#                        loops (this can lead to longer replay times), if this is true, usage of cycles will be avoided

# Merging parameters
# max_iterations: max traces to combine when merging different object type's traces
# max_retries: max number of tries we restart the merging of traces (in case, there still are unmatched shared
#                                       activities after, we pick the one with the fewest unmatched activities)
# min_traces: minimum number of traces across all object types that should be generated
# min_traces_per_obj_type: minimum number of traces per object type
# min_events_per_obj_type: minimum number of events per object type
# distribution: 0 -> UNIFORM, 1 -> BINOMIAL, 2 -> GEOMETRIC

# Log generation parameters
# start_date: start date of first event in log
# min_time_stepsize: min time between events in hours
# max_time_stepsize: max time between events in hours
